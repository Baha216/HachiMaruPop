HachiMaruPop is a cute font that imaged a circle that was popular among young Japanese girls in the 1970s and 1980s, plus elements of the current round character as well.

The momentum of the circle fads of the 70s and 80s back then seemed to have been great, and it seems that there were schools that prohibited the use of the round letters as students were all writing, too.

<p>
In addition, a circular letter contest was held, and it seems that the work selected from many entries was released as a phototype. I tried to round up to the limit while incorporating the elements of that circle and the elements of the round letters that the current Japanese girls would write.

It corresponds to Hiragana · Katakana · Alphabet · Numerals · Symbols · Kanji(chinese characters). You can also write vertically.

You can use it easily, because it contains JIS first · second level, and IBM extended Kanji(about 6700chinese characters).

I think that it is an eye-catching design although it lacks a little on readability, so it is also recommended to use it point-wise.

The name "Hachimaru" is a thing that touched "80" in the 1980s. The 80s is one of my favorite times. I think that the power to young girls 'Kawaii' such as circle letters, fancy goods and idols was a very strong era.

I hope I can express even a little "Kawaii" culture of that unique and unique 80's Japan.
